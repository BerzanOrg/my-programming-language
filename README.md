# My Programming Language

A REPL is live at [`berzanxyz.github.io`](https://berzanxyz.github.io/my-programming-language).

I've built an interpreted programming language that only supports adding and subtracting integers.

Code example: `42 + 8 - 4`




## Setup Development Environment
You need [Node](https://nodejs.org/) and [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed.
> If you already have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) installed, after you open the repository in VS Code, it will ask you to reopen the project in a dev container.



## Run Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Make Production Build
```bash
npm run build
```
